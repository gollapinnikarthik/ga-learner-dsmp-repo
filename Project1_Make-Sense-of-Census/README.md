### Project Overview

 # The project here is to maintain census record management and perform data analysis of the recorded data. 


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I had a better grip on working with numpy and I have applied the following concepts:

Array Appending
Array Slicing
Array Filtering
Array Aggregation


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Loaded the data and created a new column and used np.concatenate()  to add the new record to the variable where data is store
Calculated the measures of central tendencies and range for age coloumn 
Created columns by subsetting rows using condition filtering
