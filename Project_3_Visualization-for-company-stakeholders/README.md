### Project Overview

 # Visualise the  stakeholders of Dream Housing Finance company data and see if I can help the stakeholders arrive at some inference based on the visual plots.




### Learnings from the project

 In this project, I have applied the following concepts:

Bar plotting

Scatter plotting

Kernel Density plotting

Subplot operations

Axes modifications


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Load the data, create a variable for loan status value counts and plotted a bar graph for it to visualize if company has more loan approvals or loan disapprovals.
 
Grouped By property area and loan status and plotted a bar graph to see which areas have highest no of loan approvals and lowest no of loan approvals.

Plotted density plots for graduate and non graduate conditionally filtered data to see if Graduate people get approved a higher amount than their Non Graduate counterparts.

Plotted scatter plot to see if there is any correlation between Applicant Income and Co Applicant Income with Loan amount. If the sum of Applicant Income and Co applicant income has any relation with Loan amount. Which is better correlated to Loan amount was deduced using scatter plot.
