### Project Overview

 # # Making Inferences from Data

# Problem Statement

Bank Of New York wants to expand its branches and for that it has certain hypothesis and statements it wants to verify. Using the inferential statistics method you just learned, help the bank.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I have had a better understanding of how to use inferential statistics. In this project, I have applied the following concepts:

Confidence Interval

Central Limit Theorem

Hypothesis Testing

Chi Square Test


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Loaded the dataset and created a sample data from the population.

Calculated the mean and standard deviation of the sample data.

Calcuated the margin of error and using sample mean and margin of error calcuated the confidence intervals.

Verified if the population means falls in the sample confidence interval.

Plotted histogram using subplots for three different sample sizes for their respective means.

Conducted a hypothesis testing to check if small busineses have been charged with very high rate of interest using a z test.

Conducted a two-sided hypothesis testing to verify if installment customers have effect on load defaulters.

Performed a chi-square test on categorical variables to see if the purpose for taking a loan effects for paying them back.
