### Project Overview

 # The project here is to create a targeted marketing campaign for different segments and do comprehensive analysis of the data.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I had a better grip on working with pandas and I have applied the following concepts:

Dataframe slicing
Dataframe aggregation
Pivot table operations


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Loaded the dataset and seperated categorical variables and numerical variables and stored in different objects
Dropped column and  replaced all null values with mode values in the dataframe
Created a dataframe with pivot table and used mean as aggerate function 
Used conditional filtering to create two variable objects and calcuated their percentages
Used apply function along with lambda to do changed in the total column and applied conditional flitering to save it in a new object
Finally used groupby function and calculated mean for the column
